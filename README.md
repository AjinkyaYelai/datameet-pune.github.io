## Open Projects for DataMeet Pune chapter

Datameet is a volunteer group of civil society & programmers interested in data related issues relevant to the social sector. We work to improve the quality of public information/data on multiple issues such as public transport, education, city budgets, rural development etc. See <http://datameet.org> for more.

  **Announcement: Call for [Internships](/internship)**

On this page, we are attempting to bring together various open data projects that volunteers of DataMeet Pune chapter are working on, or want to work on. Along with the output, we want to document and openly share the work being done as it's happening, in a way that anyone interested can join in and take things forward.

There are broadly three types of work we do with data:

 1 Collect | 2 Curate | 3 Apply 
--|--|--
Bring socially relevant data out by collecting, listing, sharing about it | Digitize, curate, clean, convert the data to a better, more usable form | Visualize or otherwise apply the data; combine with other dataset(s) 
example:||

There's a fourth kind of work that has emerged from what we've been doing:

**4. Program** : Finding or creating tools like web-based scripts or apps that help to automate one or more of the above tasks, save time and make data science work easier and more doable.

## Projects

Please open our **[github wiki](https://github.com/datameet-pune/datameet-pune.github.io/wiki/Home)** for checking out the projects we're working on.

We've broken down the projects and made a detailed **[tasks list](https://github.com/datameet-pune/datameet-pune.github.io/wiki/Tasks-for-Interns)** separated by skillsets needed, so check it out and join us!

## Learning Opportunities

Learning happens quicker when there are real world, relevant things to work on, and when you can reach out to a supportive community of peers. Take up a project that actually makes sense and is important to you, find allies and experts to rely on, and you'll find yourself racing up the learning curve in no time. You'll also learn interdisciplinary skills as real world projects are often not as narrowly specialized as academic ones are. Below are some skills where there's learning opportunities with DataMeet:

  * Mapping : Basic, desktop-based and web-based
  * Mapping : Advanced GIS work with QGIS and others
  * Programming : Javascript, Python and more
  * Data Wrangling : Data extraction, scraping, cleaning, converting, curating : Learn multiple different tools and techniques to do it
  * Data Analysis : Using advanced spreadsheet techniques, R and other tools, web based tools
  * Data Visualization : d3.js, tableau, leaflet.js and more
  * Machine learning, modelling, etc

Incentive : Since we're totally open source, we encourage the learner to publish an output of their learning, like a cleaned up dataset or a viz, on their own public profile. This can be a valuable addition to their resume.

## The Team
Nikhil: Formerly in the IT sector, Nikhil has graduated from a degree-less alternative university where he self-designed his course with a community of learners from diverse backgrounds. He has multiple interests in technology, sustainability and democracy. His journey with open data started with a project with Centre for Environment Education and since then he has been involved with other voluntary projects and community initiatives. Having a presence in many networks and constantly cross-pollinating developments amongst them, he is keen to work on open data, while recognizing technology’s role as merely a tool and not an end, prioritizing simplicity and stakeholder empowerment.

Craig Dsouza : Craig is a graduate with a Master’s in Environmental Policy from the University of Delaware and currently works at SOPPECOM, Pune in research on rural water related issues. His research involves a substantial amount of data analysis and field work related to agricultural water use, cropping patterns and hydrological data. This exploration drove his curiosity on the subject of data availability & data quality in the social sector in India and consequently to Datameet’s work. He believes grassroots citizen action (which is strengthened by open data and transparency) is the key to overcoming overwhelming challenges to the equitable management of water resources in India.
